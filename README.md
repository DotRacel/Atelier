# Atelier
a server to handle lua script request

# 须知
很显然，这是我2年前刚接触Lua做的一个 gamesense云载系统，
它迄今为止还是我做过云载中后端操作最完善的一个。

但是，它的一些代码在两年后的现在看起来十分搞笑，同样，它的保护也十分弱。
总之，爱用就用，不爱用拉到，我不会提供任何帮助，您也没有任何理由拿这个项目来评价我。

# must know
Obviously, this is a gamesense cloud-based system I made 2 years ago when I first started working with Lua.
It's by far the best backend development I've ever done. (I mean it has console)

However, some of its code looks funny now, two years later, and its protection is also very weak.
Anyway, use it if you like, don't use it if you don't, I won't provide any help, and you don't have any reason to judge me with this project.
